            <h1>Git</h1>
            <p>It is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.</p>
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
</p>
            <h1>Installing Git</h1>
            <p>Mac and linux: Git should be installed already.</p>
            <p>Windows: Install git and the shell gitbash from here: https://gitforwindows.org/ 
            This includes git, gitbash, and has shell integration so that you can right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access gitbash at that location.</p>
            
            
            <h1>Git commands</h1>
            <b>The git config command</b>  
            <pre>
            git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME_HERE"
            git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL_HERE
            </pre>
            
            <p>The basic commands we are going to use in this class are:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>git clone -> retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL</li>
            <li>git pull -> fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
            <li>git add -> add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
            <li>git commit -> commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
            <li>git push -> Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Connect to GitHub with SSH</h1>
            <p>Follow these steps to create a ssh, connect to GitHub with SSH and clone your repository.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create your ssh key: Open your terminal and type
                    <pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
                    Check if your key was generated:
                    <pre>
                    <p>cd .ssh/
                    ls
                    </pre></p>
                    
                    You should see your private key (id_rsa) and public key (id_rsa.pub) inside that directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Log in to your GitHub accout.
                    Click on your profile picture (right-top). You will see a menu click on Settings.
                    You will see a menu on the left click on SSH and GPG keys and click on Add New SSH key.
                    You will give a title to that key. Key type shoud be "Authentication Key" and copy your public key (the content inside the file id_rsa.pub) in the field "Key".
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go to the following link and test your SSH connection

                </li>
           
                <li>
                   Let's clone your repository in your local computer:
                   Go to your assignments repository that we created for this class in GitHub. You will see a green button "Code", click there and select SSH to have the appropiate link that will allow you to clone your repository and copy the link you see there.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    On your terminal go inside the folder you want to clone your repository and type:
                    <pre> git clone PASTE_THE_LINK_YOU_COPIED_FROM_GITHUB_(git@...) </pre>
                             
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Go inside the folder that appears after you excecute the clone command and you will see the files you have on your GitHub repository.

            <h1>USACO Problems:</h1>
<h2><b>1. Bronze</b></h2>
<p>Cow Stomping / Lake Making</p>

<p>In order to understand this problem you need to read it multiple times. There are references to variables that are explained later in the documentation, and you have to understand all of the text for cross referencing purposes.</p>


<p>Problem 12: Lake Making [Rob Kolstad, 2008]</p>

<p>1.1 description</p>

<p>Farmer John wants his cows to help him make a lake. He has mapped the pasture where he wants to build the lake by creating an R (3 <= R <= 100) row by C (3 <= C <= 100) column grid of six foot by six foot squares and then by determining the average elevation (10 <= elev_rc <= 5000) in inches for each square.</p>


<p>Additionally, he has trained the cows in "stomp digging". The burly bovines travel in a herd that just exactly covers a 3x3 grid of squares to a grid whose upper left coordinate is R_s,C_s (1 <= R_s <= R-2; 1 <= C_s <= C-2). The cows then stomp the ground to push it down D_s (1 <= D_s <= 40) inches. The cows are quite meticulous; the cows at lower elevations will not commence stomping until the rest of the herd has joined them. Thus, not all the 3x3 grid is necessarily stomped (or perhaps some part is stomped less than some other part).</p>


<p>Given an initial set of elevations, an ordered set of N (1 <= N <= 20000) stomp digging instructions, and an elevation E (0 <= E <= 5000) for the lake's final water level, determine the volume of water (in cubic inches) that the lake will hold. It is guaranteed that the answer will not exceed 2,000,000,000. Presume that the edge of the lake contains barriers so that water can not spill over the border.</p>
               
      
            
<h2><b>2. SILVER</b></h2>
<p>Cow Travelling [Aram Shatakhtsyan, 2007]</p>
<p>This problem the algorithm is more difficult than the reading. You should still read it multiple times.</p>

<p>2.1 description</p>
<p>Searching for the very best grass, the cows are travelling about the pasture which is represented as a grid with N rows and M columns (2 <= N <= 100; 2 <= M <= 100). Keen observer Farmer John has recorded Bessie's position as (R1, C1) at a certain time and then as (R2, C2) exactly T (0 < T <= 15) seconds later. He's not sure if she passed through (R2, C2) before T seconds, but he knows she is there at time T.</p>

<p>FJ wants a program that uses this information to calculate an integer S that is the number of ways a cow can go from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) exactly in T seconds. Every second, a cow can travel from any position to a vertically or horizontally neighboring position in the pasture each second (no resting for the cows). Of course, the pasture has trees through which no cow can travel.</p>

<p>Given a map with '.'s for open pasture space and '*' for trees, calculate the number of possible ways to travel from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) in T seconds.</p>
