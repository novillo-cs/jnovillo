            <h1>Git</h1>
            <p>It is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.</p>
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
</p>
            <h1>Installing Git</h1>
            <p>Mac and linux: Git should be installed already.</p>
            <p>Windows: Install git and the shell gitbash from here: https://gitforwindows.org/ 
            This includes git, gitbash, and has shell integration so that you can right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access gitbash at that location.</p>
            
            
            <h1>Git commands</h1>
            <b>The git config command</b>  
            <pre>
            git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME_HERE"
            git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL_HERE
            </pre>
            
            <p>The basic commands we are going to use in this class are:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>git clone -> retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL</li>
            <li>git pull -> fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
            <li>git add -> add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
            <li>git commit -> commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
            <li>git push -> Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>

<h2><b>1. Bronze</b></h2>
            
<p>Cow Stomping / Lake Making</p>

<p>In order to understand this problem you need to read it multiple times. There are references to variables that are explained later in the documentation, and you have to understand all of the text for cross referencing purposes.</p>


<p>Problem 12: Lake Making [Rob Kolstad, 2008]</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>

<p>Farmer John wants his cows to help him make a lake. He has mapped the pasture where he wants to build the lake by creating an R (3 <= R <= 100) row by C (3 <= C <= 100) column grid of six foot by six foot squares and then by determining the average elevation (10 <= elev_rc <= 5000) in inches for each square.</p>


<p>Additionally, he has trained the cows in "stomp digging". The burly bovines travel in a herd that just exactly covers a 3x3 grid of squares to a grid whose upper left coordinate is R_s,C_s (1 <= R_s <= R-2; 1 <= C_s <= C-2). The cows then stomp the ground to push it down D_s (1 <= D_s <= 40) inches. The cows are quite meticulous; the cows at lower elevations will not commence stomping until the rest of the herd has joined them. Thus, not all the 3x3 grid is necessarily stomped (or perhaps some part is stomped less than some other part).</p>


<p>Given an initial set of elevations, an ordered set of N (1 <= N <= 20000) stomp digging instructions, and an elevation E (0 <= E <= 5000) for the lake's final water level, determine the volume of water (in cubic inches) that the lake will hold. It is guaranteed that the answer will not exceed 2,000,000,000. Presume that the edge of the lake contains barriers so that water can not spill over the border.</p>
               
  
<p><b>Example</b></p>
            
<p>Consider a small 4 x 6 pasture to be turned into a lake. Its initial elevations (annotated with row/column numbers) are:</p>

<p>column: 01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 : 28 25 20 32 34 36</p>
<p>row 2 : 27 25 20 20 30 34</p>
<p>row 3 : 24 20 20 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 : 20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>Interpreting the map, we see a hill in the upper right corner that rises to elevation 36; a small hill also rises to elevation 28 in the upper left corner. The middle of row 4 has a slight depression. After the cow-stomping instruction "1 4 4", the pasture has these elevations:</p>

<p>column:  01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 :  28 25 20 32 32 32</p>
<p>row 2 :  27 25 20 20 30 32</p>
<p>row 3 :  24 20 20 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 :  20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>Note that only three squares were stomped down. The other six sets of cows were waiting for the stompers to get to their level, which never happened. After stomping down the upper left corner with this instruction "1 1 10", the pasture looks like this:</p>

<p>column:  01 02 03 04 05 06</p>
<p>row 1 :  18 18 18 32 32 32</p>
<p>row 2 :  18 18 18 20 30 32</p>
<p>row 3 :  18 18 18 20 20 30</p>
<p>row 4 :  20 20 14 14 20 20</p>
  
<p>If the final elevation of the lake is to be 22 inches, the pasture has these depths:</p>

<p>column:   1  2  3  4  5  6</p>
<p>row 1 :   4  4  4 - - -</p>
<p>row 2 :   4  4  4  2 - -</p>
<p>row 3 :   4  4  4  2  2 -</p>
<p>row 4 :   2  2  8  8  2  2</p>
  
<p>This yields a total aggregated depth of 66 inches. Calculate the volume by multiplying 66 x 6 feet x 6 feet = 66 inches x 72 inches x 72 inches = 342,144 cubic inches.</p>

<h2><b>2. SILVER</b></h2>
<p>Cow Travelling [Aram Shatakhtsyan, 2007]</p>
<p>This problem the algorithm is more difficult than the reading. You should still read it multiple times.</p>

<p>2.1 description</p>
<p>Searching for the very best grass, the cows are travelling about the pasture which is represented as a grid with N rows and M columns (2 <= N <= 100; 2 <= M <= 100). Keen observer Farmer John has recorded Bessie's position as (R1, C1) at a certain time and then as (R2, C2) exactly T (0 < T <= 15) seconds later. He's not sure if she passed through (R2, C2) before T seconds, but he knows she is there at time T.</p>

<p>FJ wants a program that uses this information to calculate an integer S that is the number of ways a cow can go from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) exactly in T seconds. Every second, a cow can travel from any position to a vertically or horizontally neighboring position in the pasture each second (no resting for the cows). Of course, the pasture has trees through which no cow can travel.</p>

<p>Given a map with '.'s for open pasture space and '*' for trees, calculate the number of possible ways to travel from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) in T seconds.</p>            
    
<p><b>INPUT FORMAT:</b></p>
The name of a file in the following format

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and T

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes row i of the pasture with exactly M characters that are each '.' or '*'

* Line N+2: Four space-separated integers: R1, C1, R2, and C2.

<p><b>INPUT DETAILS:</p></b>
The pasture is 4 rows by 5 column. The cow travels from row 1, column 3 to row 1, column 5, which takes exactly 6 seconds.

<p><b>OUTPUT FORMAT:</p></b>
* Line 1: A single line with the integer S described above.

<p><b>SAMPLE OUTPUT</p></b>
1

<p><b>OUTPUT DETAILS:</p></b>
There is only one way from (1,3) to (1,5) in exactly 6 seconds (and it is the obvious one that travels around the two trees).
